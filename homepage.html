		<h2>What Is Web Development?</h2>
			<p>The client's plans are incorporated, followed by the programmer to construct a personalized website. A great example would be to think of a Lego set. To complete your build, you must follow a sketched booklet 
			to make a design. If orders are not followed correctly, your creation will not turn out the way you want. It is vital to communicate what you desire/expect the homepage to do. We will help you through this!</p>
			<br></br>
		
			<h2>Types of Coders</h2>
					<ul style= "list-style-type: square";>
					<b><li>Front-end Developer:</li></b><p> These developers help create the model; everything they do makes it look aesthetically pleasing. A front-end structure is what users would see while viewing a page through their browser.</p>
						<b><li>Back-end Developer:</li></b><p> They help outline databases to store data. Code is run and tested weekly/monthly to check for bugs and any fixes that need to be modified. Minor improvements will make your webpage run more efficiently. The faster a page can load up, the better chances of keeping a customer
						engaged on your site. People tend to click off web pages quicker when it runs slow.</p>
							<p><b><li>Full Stack Developer:</li></b><p> This type of creator does everything a Front & Back-end developer would normally do & more. The data, security, backups & all the nits and grits are their number one priority. Security infrastructure is critical; this issue ensures that any information stored on the internet does not
							get leaked to the public.</p>
							<br></br>
							</ul>
